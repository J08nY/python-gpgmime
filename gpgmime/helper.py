    Canonicalizes plain text (MIME-encoded usually) according to RFC3156.

    1. Convert all line endings to \\\\r\\\\n (DOS line endings).
    2. Ensure the text ends with a newline (\\\\r\\\\n).
    3. Encode all occurences of "From " at the beginning of a line
       to "From=20" in order to prevent other mail programs to replace
       this with "> From" (to avoid MBox conflicts) and thus invalidate
       the signature.
