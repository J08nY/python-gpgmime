`python-pgpmime` is a library for manipulating PGP mime messages.

It provides support for encrypting, decrypting, signing, and verifying
PGP mime email messages. It's based on the corresponding functionality
in [alot][1].

`python-pgpmime` is licensed under the GPL, version 3 or later.

Note that this is in a very early stage of development; it doesn't even
work, as it hasn't been fully adjusted after being pulled from the alot
source tree.
